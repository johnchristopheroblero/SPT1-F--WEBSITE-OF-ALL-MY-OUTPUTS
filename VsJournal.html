		Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XbCWmY0eqY">spatulas</a>! (What better way to say I love myself than to buy myself a spatula?)

	<p>
		My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes, so Cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both worlds.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, <q>Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you.</q> I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes? (If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)
